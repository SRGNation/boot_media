# Boot_Media
A social media website created with the design based on bootstrap's CSS, and created with PHP.

# What is this? And why is this?
Boot_Media is an open source, social networking site by SRGNation, created in PHP, and uses Bootstrap's CSS for basically every part of its design.

# Aight, seems cool, but what about the features?
Boot_Media doesn't have much in terms of features at the moment, but once the site releases, you can expect:
- Communities, and community creation.
- Likes and Dislikes.
- Commenting
- Following
- Notifications
- A front page post feed, where you can see all of your follower's and joined community's posts.
- Posting to the front page post feed.
- A Way to make it where posts can only be viewed by your Followers, Friends, Community Joiners, etc.

# That's a lot of features! But how do I set it up? I wanna try it!
It's actually pretty easy to set it up. It's pretty much how you would set up something like Ciiverse, or any other PHP website.

# Am I able to host this publically on my own since it's not released yet?
We recommend you to not do that. Besides, why would you want to host it pubically? The site is not even finished. But if you want, you're welcome to add new things to it, or fix a bug you noticed, just make a pull request with your new feature/bug fix. This is pretty much the only reason I made this open source, so you. Yes, YOU, can be able to help!
